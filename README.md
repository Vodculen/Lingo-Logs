# Lingo Logs
## What is Lingo Logs
Lingo Logs is a FOSS (Free Open Source Software) language learning software. Which also has no adverts or paid subscriptions, except for the donate button, which adds nothing to the experience. You can contribute or develop anything for this website. Though it will have to go through me first and other lead members.

## How to Contribute
First you need to figure out what team you want to be part of. You can either be part of Developers or Linguists. If you want to make changes in the code like styling, scripting, or structuring. Then the lead members will have to go through it and figure out if its a keep or throw. With the languages stuff you have to follow the guide bellow so read up.

Next figure out what file to work on and help develop. With some it can just be a matter of just copy and pasting, or writing new code. With languages you have to make sure you are fluent in the Target Language (Second Language) and make sure you could accurately translate it into your Native Language (First Language). Like in the last paragraph just read through the whole documents.

Finally, be active and a functioning human is society and work with others. Since this project is massive, mind numbing, and needs a lot of collaboration to get this done. If your toxic and/or not respected your commits won't be accepted. So will the types and parts of the project you'll get. In the end you will be kicked because of that.

## Needed Resources
### General
- **Discord:** To communicate with the community more please install and use Discord. The sever link is right here https://discord.gg/QTRGmg8H!
- **GitHub:** I don't know how your reading this without GitHub. But you do need it to contribute really anything for this project.

### Language Team
- **Knowledge of Target & Native Language:** You need to be able to be fluent in the Target Language (Second Language) and be able to translate it into the Native Language (First Language). This will be needed so we can get very accurate material. We will compare it to the other resources and to other contributors to check if the material is the most accurate. **No using any Translate app or just copying from other apps!**
- **Knowledge of Syntax:** Since most might not know how to code (You should probably learn since its annoying to work with the syntax). We have a special syntax for making Language Documentation Pages. You can find this in the section "Language Documentation Page Syntax"

### Developer Team
- **Knowledge of WebDev Kit:** You will need to know about: HTML, JavaScript, CSS, SQL and PHP more will be removed or added later depending on whats needed.
- **VS Code:** In reality you can use any code editor you want. I just suggest to use this incase you run into problems I can help better.

## Language Documentation Page Syntax
### Setup

First, make a file with the following "TargetLanguageNativeLanguageUsername.txt" and put it under the filepath "LanguageTeam/TargetLanguage/NativeLanguage/". Please don't be dumb and just replace "TargetLanguage" with the name of the Target Language (Second Language) and with "Native Language" with the name of the Native Language (First Language). As well as replacing "Username" with your username. We capitalized ever first character of a word.

Next, you can follow the style guide down below.
### Style Guide
- **Title (# Title):** You will only use the title once and it will be used to declare what the chapter topic teaches.
- **Section (## Section):** You will only use this to split the chapter up to make it more bite sized to learn.
- **Normal Text (Text):** This is used for the basic text and only use it for basic text.
- **Light Text ('Light Text'):** This can be used for translations into the Native Language. 
- **Bold Text ("Bold Text"):** This will only be used when making **Important** information stand out. *This will be defined more later*.
- **Line (---):** This is **Only** used under the Title and at the end of a Section.
- **List (- List):** Only use this for teaching a lot of stuff that are similar. Like, numbers, jobs, or food if they don't have many different congregations.
- **Pronunciation ({pronunciation}):** Use a table that defines
- **Audio (<Audio.mp3>):** You will need to use the .mp3 file format. This is only used for sentences or how the language will sound.
- **Linked Audio (/LinkedAudio.mp3/):** Like Audio you will need to put the .mp3 extension at the end. This audio will be put in a link instead of a audio player. Use this for individual words or under the phonemes.
- **Table ([Table]):** Use this when teaching a lot of stuff that are similar and has a lot of congregations. Like, Pronouns, Tenses, or etc.

### Answer Sheet
https://github.com/Vodculen/Lingo-Logs/blob/main/Language%20Documentation%20Page%20Syntax.txt

### Extra Information
- Please also attach the .mp3 file under the filepath "Audio/TargetLanguage/NativeLanguage/" and name it "TargetLanguageNativeLanguageUsernameSentence.mp3"
- Please provide your own audio, if not find others that can.
- How to use tables:
- **INPORTANT:** You will need to install: npm install electron --save-dev, npm install --save-dev @electron-forge/cli, npx electron-forge import, npm install --save-dev @electron-forge/publisher-github.
